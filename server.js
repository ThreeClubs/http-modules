// 1) declare a variable called http and import "http" inside require

// 2)create a variable called "server" and use http and createServer method then pass in "req" and "res" as params
//using res.write and res.end, write some code that displays "Hello" when we visit our server on the browser

// 3) use our server with .listen to check that we're running and console log a server listen message such as "Server has started on 4000" etc

// 4) Write a conditional statement inside our server that checks if we are at "/" (localhost:4000/ etc..)
// and if we are NOT there() ie we write something like "/blah" )then we get a 404 error

// 5) add an additional condition which checks for an another endpoint of your own creation such as "/stuff" or "/message"
// you can make your own api and populate it with that, or you can just put in whatever you like!
// share your unique content with the class!

// 6) BONUS rewrite the code using writeHead and defind content type, then put html elements directly in the end statement to give your content
// some style and structure
